P0: My First Kernel Mod
.SH Synopsis
The goal of P0 was to create a custom kernel boot message
.SH Description
.nf
sudo find / -name kernel
.RS
I learned of this command from ex1
This command will find a file with the given name / indicates that it will search from the root directory and search all files 
I used this to find all files which related to the kernel
.RE
.PP
sudo grep -rl "rcu_end_inkernel_boot()" /usr/rep/src/reptilian-kernel
.RS
I learned about this command from ex1.
This command will search files in the given directory for files containing the phrase "rcu_end_inkernel_boot()" -r will search recursively and -l will only return one file per match.
I used this command to find the file required to edit.
.RE
.PP
usr/rep/src/reptilian-kernel/init/main.c
.RS
I used find and grep to locate the file that containe dthe specified function in the directions
I changed the line before rcu_end_inkernel_boot() to pr_emerg("\n##### Eric Clayton (UFID: 4794-1651) Hello #####\n\n");
I made this change to print out a custom boot message.

.SH TESTING
.nf
I reverted to a previous snapshot and ran:
.RS
sftp reptilian@192.168.108.128
#Entered password: reptilian
lcd C:/COP4600/Projects/P0
cd /usr/rep/src/reptilian-kernel			# Change local directory to where p0.diff is
put p0.diff						# Transfer p0.diff to clean vm
.RE
.PP
Then open the remote vm from ubuntu and ran: 
.RS
ssh reptilian@192.168.108.128
#Entered password: reptilian
cd /usr/rep/src/reptilian-kernel
git apply p0.diff					# Apply the diff file 
make && sudo make install && sudo make modules_install	# Build 
#Entered password: reptilian
.RE
.PP
Finally I ran the vm to see if the changes applied.
.SH BUGS
No known bugs.
